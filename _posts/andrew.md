## Overview

First and foremost, TypeScript puts the super in superset, especially in a team environment. As far as primary prebuilts are concerened, the "Next.js" framework is top-notch. Its versatility alone renders it king of one-size-fits-all solutions. It saves time, streamlines optimization, and is blazing fast to enhance end-user experience. Not to mention its edge-network sidekick, Vercel, which simplifies the process of deployment and is so fast you might miss load-time while blinking. 

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a JavaScript superset, it supports additional properties such as annotations, decorators, generics, interfaces, enums, modules, tuples, and more. It offers a uniqe advantage of having preconfigured polyfill support. How? There is a primary tsconfig.json file in the root of every TypeScript project. Within this file, the "target" key has a corresponding value that specifies the ECMAScript target version (JavaScript's actual name) which the TypeScript will be compiled into on build. So, while we are enjoying the benefits of coding with modern syntax (ESNext), this code compiles down to ES5 (2009) JavaScript upon generating a production build. Why does this matter? This greatly bolsters the accessibility of the platform for users still running legacy operating systems or using legacy browsers. For example, Microsoft just terminated support for Windows 7 users and Internet Explorer 11 which means that they will no longer receive updates. By compiling down to ES5, this content is just as accessible to legacy users as it is to users running more current software. The other plus? No longer having to rely on often bulky polyfill libraries.

### TypeScript Trends

It has become an increasingly popular tool for development environments, particularly in team settings. This is because TypeScript implements strict type checking and requires that type annotations be called in many scenarios (a feature not supported by Vanilla JavaScript). Unlike JavaScript, it won't launch and allow a subtle error to persist. On the contrary, TypeScript disallows the program from launching locally if an error is detected. Its intellisense is far superior to that of JavaScript's as well. This makes the process of debugging relatively painless and prevents bugs from snowballing into something truly catastrophic.
